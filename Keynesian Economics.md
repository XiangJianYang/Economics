### 人们如何批评凯恩斯主义经济学？（How people criticize Keynesian Economics?）

对凯恩斯主义经济学的批评来自各个方面，批评者从理论、实践和意识形态的角度进行争论。以下是一些主要的批评：

1.**长期低效率**：批评者认为，凯恩斯主义政策，特别是那些涉及政府支出以刺激需求的政策，可能会导致长期经济低效率。他们认为，这些政策会扭曲市场信号，导致资源配置不当，并可能在资产市场中产生不可持续的泡沫。

2.**通货膨胀**：主要批评之一是凯恩斯主义的财政刺激可能导致通货膨胀。当政府增加支出而没有相应增加生产时，就会导致物价上涨。批评者认为，这种通货膨胀会侵蚀购买力，并可能在长期内损害经济。

3.**政府债务**：凯恩斯主义经济学经常主张在经济低迷时期增加政府支出，这会导致政府债务水平上升。批评者认为，这些债务会给子孙后代带来沉重负担，还会导致利率上升，挤出私人投资。

4.**时机和政治现实**：实施凯恩斯主义政策需要及时和精确的行动，但批评者认为，政府不够灵活，无法有效实施这些政策。他们还指出，政治考虑往往导致刺激措施在经济复苏后继续实施，进一步加剧债务和通胀问题。

5.**依赖政府干预**：批评者认为，依赖政府干预来稳定经济会导致难以逆转的依赖。他们认为，这破坏了自由市场的自我修正性质，并可能导致长期的经济停滞。

6.**质疑乘数效应**：凯恩斯主义经济学依赖乘数效应的概念，即政府支出导致收入和消费增加，进一步刺激经济。批评者质疑这一机制的有效性，认为实际的乘数效应可能比凯恩斯主义者声称的要小得多，尤其是在开放经济中，增加支出可能导致进口增加，而不是国内生产增加。

7.**供应侧批评**：供应侧经济学家认为，凯恩斯主义过于关注需求，而没有考虑供应的重要性。他们认为，通过鼓励投资和生产，减少税收和监管负担是刺激经济增长的更有效方式。

8.**道德风险**：有人担心凯恩斯主义政策会造成道德风险，鼓励企业和个人冒险行为，期望政府在困难时期伸出援手。这可能导致未来更严重的经济衰退。

9.**经验证据**：批评者还指出了经验证据，表明凯恩斯主义政策并不总是带来积极的结果。他们认为，在某些情况下，比如日本的“失去的十年”，大规模的财政刺激未能刺激经济可持续增长。

Criticism of Keynesian economics comes from various fronts, with detractors arguing on theoretical, practical, and ideological grounds. Here are some of the key criticisms:

1.**Long-Term Inefficiency**: Critics argue that Keynesian policies, particularly those involving government spending to stimulate demand, can lead to inefficiencies in the economy over the long term. They suggest that these policies can distort market signals, leading to misallocation of resources and potentially creating unsustainable bubbles in asset markets.

2.**Inflation**: One of the primary criticisms is that Keynesian fiscal stimulus can lead to inflation. When the government increases spending without a corresponding increase in production, it can lead to a rise in prices. Critics argue that this inflation erodes purchasing power and can hurt the economy in the long run.

3.**Government Debt**: Keynesian economics often advocates for increased government spending during economic downturns, which can lead to higher levels of government debt. Critics argue that this debt is burdensome for future generations and can also lead to higher interest rates, crowding out private investment.

4.**Timing and Political Realities**: Implementing Keynesian policies requires timely and precise action, but critics argue that governments are not agile enough to implement these policies effectively. They also point out that political considerations often lead to stimulus measures being continued even when the economy has recovered, further exacerbating debt and inflation issues.

5.**Dependency on Government Intervention**: Critics argue that reliance on government intervention to stabilize the economy can lead to a dependency that is hard to reverse. They suggest that it undermines the self-correcting nature of free markets and can lead to prolonged periods of economic stagnation.

6.**Questioning the Multiplier Effect**: Keynesian economics relies on the concept of the multiplier effect, where government spending leads to increased income and consumption, further stimulating the economy. Critics question the effectiveness of this mechanism, arguing that the actual multiplier effect may be much smaller than Keynesians claim, especially in an open economy where increased spending can lead to increased imports rather than domestic production.

7.**Supply-Side Criticisms**: Supply-side economists argue that Keynesianism focuses too much on demand without considering the importance of supply. They contend that reducing taxes and regulatory burdens is a more effective way to stimulate economic growth by encouraging investment and production.

8.**Moral Hazard**: There is a concern that Keynesian policies can create moral hazard, encouraging risky behavior by firms and individuals with the expectation that the government will bail them out in times of trouble. This can lead to more severe economic downturns in the future.

9.**Empirical Evidence**: Critics also point to empirical evidence, suggesting that Keynesian policies have not always led to positive outcomes. They argue that in some cases, such as Japan’s “Lost Decade(s),” extensive fiscal stimulus has failed to spur sustainable economic growth.

### 凯恩斯主义经济学如何应用于日本的“失去的十年”？（How was Keynesian economics applied to Japan's lost decade?）

日本的“失去的十年”是指 20 世纪 90 年代日本经济停滞的时期，这一时期一直延续到 21 世纪，对该国二战后的经济繁荣构成了挑战。日本政府对这一长期经济低迷时期的应对措施为凯恩斯主义经济学的应用提供了一个有趣的案例研究，尽管这也是关于此类政策在应对根深蒂固的经济问题方面的有效性的争论话题。

背景

经济困境始于 20 世纪 90 年代初，此前 20 世纪 80 年代末资产价格泡沫破灭。这一泡沫的特点是房地产和股票市场价格高度膨胀。泡沫破灭后，引发了严重的银行业危机，消费者和企业支出急剧下降。结果是长期的经济停滞，增长缓慢，通货紧缩，公共债务水平高企。

凯恩斯主义政策的应用

为了应对这些挑战，日本政府实施了几项凯恩斯主义的措施，旨在振兴经济：

1.**财政刺激**：在整个 20 世纪 90 年代和 21 世纪，日本推出了许多财政刺激计划，其中包括旨在创造就业机会和向经济注入资金的大型公共工程项目。这符合凯恩斯主义通过政府支出刺激需求来抵消经济衰退的建议。

2.**货币宽松**：虽然不是纯粹的凯恩斯主义（更符合货币政策），但日本央行 (BoJ) 采取了低利率政策来鼓励借贷和投资。在 20 世纪 90 年代末和 21 世纪，日本央行还尝试了量化宽松政策，购买政府债券和其他金融资产以增加货币供应量并对抗通货紧缩。

3.**政府借款**：财政刺激措施导致政府大量借款，导致日本成为世界上公共债务与 GDP 比率最高的国家之一。凯恩斯主义理论通常支持政府在经济低迷时期借款来弥补赤字支出，并期望经济因此增长，从而允许债务随着时间的推移得到管理。

批评和挑战

凯恩斯主义经济学在日本“失去的十年”期间的应用受到了褒贬不一的评价：

1.**有限的成功**：虽然一些人认为这些措施有助于防止更深层次的经济危机，但批评者认为，它们在恢复强劲的经济增长方面基本上没有成功。日本经济仍然停滞不前，周期性衰退、通货紧缩，银行业因不良贷款而负担沉重。

2.**通货紧缩**：尽管日本通过货币宽松和财政刺激来应对通货紧缩，但在 20 世纪 90 年代和 21 世纪的大部分时间里，日本仍在努力应对通货紧缩压力。通货紧缩可能导致消费支出减少，因为人们预期未来价格会下降，从而进一步加剧经济停滞。

3.**债务水平**：公共债务的大幅增加引发了人们对日本财政状况长期可持续性的担忧。凯恩斯主义的批评者指出，日本就是一个例子，说明大规模财政刺激可能导致债务水平过高，而不一定能恢复经济健康。

4.**结构性问题**：一些经济学家认为，日本的“失去的十年”凸显了凯恩斯主义财政和货币政策在解决经济结构性问题方面的局限性，例如人口老龄化、劳动力市场僵化以及某些行业竞争力下降。

总之，日本在“失去的十年”中的经历说明了实施凯恩斯主义经济政策以应对长期经济停滞的适用性和复杂性。它凸显了使用财政和货币干预措施刺激增长的挑战，尤其是在存在根深蒂固的结构性问题的情况下。

Japan’s “Lost Decade” refers to a period of economic stagnation in Japan during the 1990s, which extended into the 2000s, challenging the country’s post-World War II economic boom. The Japanese government’s response to this prolonged period of economic malaise provides an interesting case study in the application of Keynesian economics, though it’s also a subject of debate regarding the effectiveness of such policies in combating deep-seated economic problems.

Background

The economic troubles began in the early 1990s, following the bursting of an asset price bubble in the late 1980s. This bubble was characterized by highly inflated real estate and stock market prices. When the bubble burst, it led to a severe banking crisis, accompanied by a sharp decline in consumer and business spending. The result was a prolonged period of economic stagnation, with low growth, deflation, and high levels of public debt.

Keynesian Policies Applied

In response to these challenges, the Japanese government implemented several Keynesian-inspired measures aimed at reviving the economy:

1.**Fiscal Stimulus**: Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Japan launched numerous fiscal stimulus packages, which included large-scale public works projects aimed at creating jobs and injecting money into the economy. This was in line with Keynesian prescriptions for counteracting economic downturns through government spending to stimulate demand.

2.**Monetary Easing**: Though not purely Keynesian (and more in line with monetary policy), the Bank of Japan (BoJ) adopted a policy of low interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the BoJ also experimented with quantitative easing, buying government bonds and other financial assets to increase the money supply and combat deflation.

3.**Government Borrowing**: The fiscal stimulus efforts led to significant government borrowing, resulting in Japan having one of the highest levels of public debt in relation to GDP in the world. Keynesian theory generally supports the idea of government borrowing to finance deficit spending during economic downturns, with the expectation that the economy will grow as a result, allowing the debt to be managed over time.

Criticisms and Challenges

The application of Keynesian economics in Japan during its Lost Decade(s) has been met with mixed assessments:

1.**Limited Success**: While some argue that these measures helped prevent an even deeper economic crisis, critics contend that they were largely unsuccessful in restoring robust economic growth. Japan’s economy remained stagnant, with periodic recessions, deflation, and a banking sector burdened by non-performing loans.

2.**Deflation**: Despite efforts to combat deflation through monetary easing and fiscal stimulus, Japan struggled with deflationary pressures for much of the 1990s and 2000s. Deflation can lead to decreased consumer spending, as people anticipate lower prices in the future, further exacerbating economic stagnation.

3.**Debt Levels**: The substantial increase in public debt has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of Japan’s fiscal position. Critics of Keynesianism point to Japan as an example of how large-scale fiscal stimulus can lead to burdensome debt levels without necessarily restoring economic health.

4.**Structural Issues**: Some economists argue that Japan’s Lost Decade(s) underscore the limitations of Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies in addressing structural problems within an economy, such as an aging population, labor market rigidity, and a declining competitiveness in certain industries.

In summary, Japan’s experience during its Lost Decade(s) illustrates both the application and the complexities of implementing Keynesian economic policies in response to prolonged economic stagnation. It highlights the challenges of using fiscal and monetary interventions to stimulate growth, especially in the presence of deep-rooted structural issues.

### 凯恩斯主义经济学为何未能在日本“失去的十年”中取得成功？（Why did Keynesian economics not succeed in Japan's lost decade?）

凯恩斯主义经济学在日本“失去的十年”中取得的有限成功可以归因于几个因素。虽然凯恩斯主义政策（包括财政刺激和货币宽松）是为了抵消经济停滞和通货紧缩而实施的，但其有效性受到一系列结构性、制度性和政策相关挑战的阻碍。以下是凯恩斯主义经济学在此期间未能完全成功重振日本经济的原因：

1.**资产泡沫破裂的规模和持续性**：日本资产泡沫破裂影响深远，房地产和股票市场估值严重过高。随后的调整非常严重，银行留下了大量不良贷款，破坏了金融体系的稳定性。金融危机的规模超出了最初的预期，经济对刺激措施的反应弱于预期。

2.**应对不足和延迟**：一些经济学家认为，日本政府对经济衰退的应对过于缓慢，而且最初规模不足。虽然最终推出了大规模的财政刺激计划，但延迟实施激进措施可能使通货紧缩预期扎根，从而更难刺激需求。

3.**结构性问题**：日本面临着根深蒂固的结构性问题，这些问题无法通过凯恩斯主义的需求管理政策直接解决。这些问题包括人口老龄化、劳动力市场僵化、出生率下降以及某些行业的生产力和创新挑战。这些结构性问题需要更有针对性的改革，而这些改革实施起来更慢、更困难。

4.**通货紧缩螺旋**：日本经济陷入通货紧缩螺旋，物价下跌导致消费者推迟购买，预计物价会进一步下跌。这减少了经济需求的关键组成部分——消费者支出，并使财政和货币政策难以获得支持。持续的通货紧缩侵蚀了债务的实际价值，进一步削弱了消费者和企业的信心。

5.**僵尸企业**：僵尸企业现象——尽管没有盈利，但通过宽松的信贷和政府支持维持运营的企业——加剧了经济低迷。这些企业挤占了生产率更高、创新性更强的行业的投资，导致效率低下，抑制了经济复苏。

6.**银行业问题**：银行业背负着不良贷款和缺乏信心的负担，不愿放贷，限制了货币宽松政策的有效性。尽管采取了低利率和量化宽松措施，但货币政策的传导机制受损。

7.**公共债务**：大规模的财政刺激导致公共债务大幅增加。随着债务负担的增加，对财政可持续性的担忧开始限制政府继续采取激进支出措施的能力。高额债务水平也引发了人们对未来增税或削减支出的担忧，可能会削弱刺激措施的积极效果。

8.**全球经济状况**：外部因素，包括其他国家的经济状况和汇率波动，也发挥了作用。作为一个严重依赖出口的经济体，日本受到主要市场经济衰退和日元相对于其他货币的价值的影响。

总之，虽然凯恩斯主义经济学为解决日本经济在“失去的十年”期间的需求不足提供了框架，但深层次的结构性问题、金融危机的规模、通货紧缩动态和政策实施挑战等因素限制了这些措施的有效性。这一经验凸显了使用财政和货币工具应对长期经济停滞的复杂性，尤其是在存在重大结构性挑战的情况下。

The limited success of Keynesian economics in Japan during its Lost Decade(s) can be attributed to several factors. While Keynesian policies, which include fiscal stimulus and monetary easing, were implemented to counteract economic stagnation and deflation, their effectiveness was hampered by a range of structural, institutional, and policy-related challenges. Here’s why Keynesian economics did not fully succeed in reviving Japan’s economy during this period:

1.**Magnitude and Persistence of Asset Bubble Burst**: The collapse of the asset bubble in Japan was profound, with significant overvaluation of real estate and stock markets. The subsequent correction was severe and left banks with a large number of non-performing loans, undermining the financial system’s stability. The scale of the financial crisis exceeded initial expectations, and the economy’s response to stimulus measures was weaker than anticipated.

2.**Insufficient and Delayed Response**: Some economists argue that the Japanese government’s response to the economic downturn was too slow and initially insufficient in scale. While substantial fiscal stimulus packages were eventually rolled out, the delay in implementing aggressive measures may have allowed deflationary expectations to take root, making it harder to stimulate demand.

3.**Structural Problems**: Japan faced deep-seated structural issues that were not directly addressable through Keynesian demand management policies. These included an aging population, labor market rigidities, a declining birth rate, and challenges in productivity and innovation in certain sectors. Such structural problems required more targeted reforms, which were slower and more difficult to implement.

4.**Deflationary Spiral**: Japan’s economy entered a deflationary spiral, where falling prices led consumers to delay purchases, anticipating that prices would fall further. This reduced consumer spending, a key component of economic demand, and made it difficult for fiscal and monetary policy to gain traction. The persistence of deflation eroded the real value of debt and further weakened consumer and business confidence.

5.**Zombie Companies**: The phenomenon of “zombie companies” – firms that were kept afloat through easy credit and government support despite being unprofitable – contributed to economic malaise. These companies crowded out investment in more productive and innovative sectors, leading to inefficiencies and stifling economic renewal.

6.**Banking Sector Issues**: The banking sector, burdened with non-performing loans and a lack of confidence, was hesitant to lend, limiting the effectiveness of monetary easing policies. Despite low interest rates and quantitative easing measures, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy was impaired.

7.**Public Debt**: The substantial fiscal stimulus led to a significant increase in public debt. As the debt burden grew, concerns about fiscal sustainability began to limit the government’s ability to continue with aggressive spending measures. High levels of debt also raised concerns about future tax increases or spending cuts, potentially undermining the positive effects of stimulus efforts.

8.**Global Economic Conditions**: External factors, including economic conditions in other countries and exchange rate fluctuations, also played a role. As a heavily export-dependent economy, Japan was affected by economic downturns in key markets and by the yen’s value relative to other currencies.

In summary, while Keynesian economics provided a framework for addressing the demand shortfall in Japan’s economy during the Lost Decade(s), a combination of deep-seated structural issues, the scale of the financial crisis, deflationary dynamics, and policy implementation challenges limited the effectiveness of these measures. The experience highlighted the complexity of using fiscal and monetary tools to combat prolonged economic stagnation, especially in the presence of significant structural challenges.

### 经济学在日本失去的十年里能做得更好吗？（Could Economics have done better in Japan's lost decade?）

日本的“失去的十年”是指 20 世纪 90 年代初资产价格泡沫破灭后的一段时期，这导致了整个 20 世纪 90 年代的长期经济停滞，有些人认为这种停滞一直持续到 21 世纪。这一时期出现了低增长、通货紧缩、银行业危机等经济挑战。经济政策和经济理论方面能否在日本失去的十年里做得更好是一个复杂而多方面的问题。以下是经济可能有助于取得更好结果的几个领域：

1. **尽早干预资产泡沫**

一个可能得到改善的领域是尽早发现和干预失去的十年之前的资产泡沫。到 20 世纪 80 年代末，日本的房地产和股票市场价格已经达到了异常高的水平。日本央行和其他监管机构为遏制过度投机而采取的更积极行动，或许可以减轻随后的崩盘的严重程度。然而，实时识别和消除泡沫是出了名的困难，而且过早干预总是有可能抑制经济增长。

2. **银行业改革**

银行业危机是“失去的十年”的一个主要特征。日本银行背负着不良贷款，这阻碍了它们放贷的能力，并导致了通货紧缩的恶性循环。更快、更有力地重组银行业，包括确认和减记坏账，可能会促进经济更快复苏。解决这些问题的延迟使问题更加严重。

3. **货币政策创新**

日本央行因降息太慢和对抗通货紧缩不够积极而受到批评。直到 2001 年，日本央行才采用零利率政策 (ZIRP) 并开始量化宽松 (QE)。一些经济学家认为，更具创新性和激进性的货币政策，例如更早采用量化宽松政策甚至探索负利率，可能有助于更有效地应对通货紧缩压力。

4. **财政政策和结构性改革**

日本在“失去的十年”期间的财政政策方法是刺激措施和巩固公共财政的尝试相结合。批评者认为，刺激措施往往针对性不强，而减少公共债务的努力实施过早，从而抑制了经济复苏。此外，增加劳动力市场灵活性、鼓励创业和改革公司治理的结构性改革也进展缓慢。在这些领域采取更果断的行动可能会改善经济表现。

5. **心理和人口因素**

“失去的十年”还以消费者和企业的通货紧缩心态为特征，导致他们推迟购买和投资，以期未来价格下跌。解决这种心态不仅需要改变经济政策，还需要努力恢复信心。此外，日本人口老龄化和出生率下降给经济增长带来了额外的挑战，这表明还需要制定应对人口结构变化的政策。

总之，虽然事后看来可以清楚地看到可以采取哪些不同的措施，但日本在失去的十年期间面临的挑战是多方面的，而且根深蒂固。经济理论和政策本可以在几个领域取得更好的结果，但日本经济形势前所未有的性质也意味着政策制定者正在探索未知领域，这使得复苏任务异常困难。

Japan’s “Lost Decade” refers to the period following the burst of the asset price bubble in the early 1990s, which led to a prolonged period of economic stagnation that extended through the 1990s, and by some accounts, lasted into the 2000s. The period was marked by low growth, deflation, and a banking crisis, among other economic challenges. The question of whether economics—both in terms of economic policy and economic theory—could have done better during Japan’s Lost Decade is complex and multifaceted. Here are several areas where economics might have potentially contributed to a better outcome:

1. **Earlier Intervention in the Asset Bubble**

One area of potential improvement could have been earlier recognition and intervention in the asset bubble that preceded the Lost Decade. By the late 1980s, Japan’s real estate and stock market prices had reached extraordinarily high levels. More aggressive action by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and other regulatory bodies to tame speculative excesses might have mitigated the severity of the subsequent crash. However, identifying and deflating bubbles in real-time is notoriously difficult, and there is always the risk of premature intervention stifling economic growth.

2. **Banking Sector Reforms**

The banking crisis was a central feature of the Lost Decade. Japanese banks were saddled with non-performing loans, which hindered their ability to lend and contributed to the deflationary spiral. Faster and more forceful restructuring of the banking sector, including the recognition and write-down of bad debts, could have facilitated a quicker economic recovery. Delay in addressing these issues compounded the problems.

3. **Monetary Policy Innovations**

The Bank of Japan was criticized for being too slow to cut interest rates and for not being aggressive enough in combating deflation. It wasn’t until 2001 that the BoJ adopted a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and began quantitative easing (QE). Some economists argue that more innovative and aggressive monetary policy, such as earlier adoption of QE or even exploring negative interest rates, might have helped to counter deflationary pressures more effectively.

4. **Fiscal Policy and Structural Reforms**

Japan’s approach to fiscal policy during the Lost Decade was a mix of stimulus measures and attempts to consolidate public finances. Critics argue that the stimulus was often poorly targeted, while efforts to reduce public debt were prematurely implemented, thus dampening economic recovery. Moreover, structural reforms to increase labor market flexibility, encourage entrepreneurship, and reform corporate governance were slow to be adopted. More decisive action in these areas might have improved economic performance.

5. **Psychological and Demographic Factors**

The Lost Decade was also characterized by a deflationary mindset among consumers and businesses, leading to delayed purchases and investment in anticipation of lower prices in the future. Addressing this mindset required not just economic policy changes but also efforts to restore confidence. Furthermore, Japan’s aging population and declining birthrate posed additional challenges to economic growth, suggesting that policies to address demographic shifts were also needed.

In conclusion, while hindsight provides clear insights into what could have been done differently, the challenges faced by Japan during the Lost Decade were multifaceted and deeply entrenched. Economic theory and policy could have potentially contributed to a better outcome in several areas, but the unprecedented nature of Japan’s economic situation also meant that policymakers were navigating uncharted waters, making the task of recovery exceptionally difficult.
