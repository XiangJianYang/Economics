### 中国人从出生到退休都在内卷，中国社会将中国人置于从出生到退休连续不断的囚徒困境中。（The Chinese people are in an involution from birth to retirement, and Chinese society places the Chinese people in a continuous prisoner's dilemma from birth to retirement.）

“内卷化”这一概念越来越多地被用来描述当代中国的某些社会经济现象。内卷化最初是人类学术语，指的是社会或经济变得越来越复杂和竞争激烈，但生产力却没有相应提高，生活水平也没有显著改善的过程。在中国，“内卷化”捕捉了个人从教育到就业乃至其他方面所经历的激烈竞争和压力，这些竞争和压力往往受到社会期望和对成功和成就的根深蒂固的价值观的驱动。

当考虑囚徒困境与中国社会内卷化概念的关系时，从出生到退休的几个关键阶段确实可以通过这个视角来审视：

1.**教育**：从很小的时候起，中国学生就面临着巨大的学业压力，高考（全国大学入学考试）就是一个典型例子。由于考试风险高，竞争非常激烈，考试可以决定一个人未来的职业前景和社会地位。在这里，囚徒困境显而易见，因为学生可能更喜欢更平衡的教育和生活，但竞争环境迫使他们优先考虑学业成就，往往以牺​​牲个人利益和幸福为代价，因为他们知道其他人也会这样做，以确保他们在顶尖大学的地位。

2.**就业**：进入职场后，人们经常会遇到一种过度劳累的文化，一些行业盛行的臭名昭著的“996”工作文化（每周工作6天，早上9点到晚上9点）就是一个例子。工人可能更喜欢更平衡的工作与生活比例，但他们长时间工作，因为他们认为其他人这样做都是为了获得晋升和工作保障，这使他们陷入了持续竞争和内卷的循环。

3.**住房和家庭生活**：购买住房和为家人提供稳定环境的压力进一步加剧了内卷循环。大城市的高生活成本和社会对房屋所有权的期望使个人处于必须加班加点才能买得起房子的境地，即使这意味着牺牲个人福祉和家庭时间。

4.**退休**：对退休储蓄和社会保障制度的充分性的担忧，加上孝道规范，意味着个人继续面临养活自己和年迈父母的压力。这种情况可能导致囚徒困境，年轻一代感到不得不将财务安全置于一切之上，从而继续内卷化循环。

在每个阶段，个人可能更喜欢集体行动可以带来更平衡、竞争更少的社会的情景。然而，在竞争激烈的环境中落后的恐惧迫使他们做出延续内卷化循环的选择。解决这一社会困境需要系统性变革，包括改革教育和经济体系、促进工作与生活的平衡，以及将社会规范和价值观转向可持续性和福祉，而不是无休止的竞争。

The concept of “involution” has been increasingly used to describe certain socio-economic phenomena in contemporary China. Originally a term in anthropology, involution refers to a process where a society or an economy becomes increasingly complex and competitive, yet without corresponding increases in productivity or significant improvements in living standards. In the context of China, “involution” captures the intense competition and pressure experienced by individuals from education to employment and beyond, often driven by societal expectations and the deeply ingrained value placed on success and achievement.

When considering the framework of the prisoner’s dilemma in relation to the concept of involution in Chinese society, several key stages from birth to retirement can indeed be examined through this lens:

1.**Education**: From a young age, Chinese students face immense pressure to excel academically, epitomized by the gaokao (the national college entrance examination). The competition is fierce because of the high stakes associated with the exam, which can determine one’s future career prospects and social status. Here, the prisoner’s dilemma is evident as students might prefer to have a more balanced education and life, but the competitive environment forces them to prioritize academic achievement, often at the expense of personal interests and well-being, because they know others will do the same to secure their places in top universities.

2.**Employment**: Upon entering the workforce, individuals often encounter a culture of overwork, exemplified by the notorious “996” work culture (working from 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week) prevalent in some sectors. Workers may prefer a more balanced work-life ratio but engage in long hours because they perceive that everyone else is doing so to secure promotions and job security, propelling them into a cycle of continuous competition and involution.

3.**Housing and Family Life**: The pressure to purchase a home and provide a stable environment for one’s family further contributes to the cycle of involution. The high cost of living in major cities and societal expectations regarding homeownership places individuals in a situation where they must work excessively to afford housing, even if this means sacrificing personal well-being and family time.

4.**Retirement**: Concerns about the adequacy of retirement savings and the social security system, coupled with filial piety norms, mean that individuals continue to face pressure to support themselves and their aging parents. This situation can lead to a prisoner’s dilemma where younger generations feel compelled to prioritize financial security above all else, continuing the cycle of involution.

In each of these stages, individuals might prefer a scenario where collective actions could lead to a more balanced and less competitive society. However, the fear of falling behind in a highly competitive environment compels them to make choices that perpetuate the cycle of involution. Addressing this societal dilemma requires systemic changes, including reforming educational and economic systems, promoting work-life balance, and shifting societal norms and values towards sustainability and well-being rather than relentless competition.

### 有什么方法可以从个人角度解决这一问题？（Is there any way to solve this problem from a personal perspective?）

从个人角度解决中国社会内卷化和持续存在的囚徒困境问题具有挑战性，因为这些问题深深植根于社会结构和文化规范。然而，个人可以采取措施应对这些压力，并可能随着时间的推移影响更广泛的变革。以下是个人可以考虑的几种策略：

1.**心态转变**：培养个人理解，即成功和幸福可以用多种方式来定义，而不仅仅是通过学业成就、职业发展或物质财富。接受对成功的不同定义有助于减轻符合社会期望的压力，并使个人能够追求更充实的道路。

2.**设定界限**：学会在工作和个人生活方面设定健康的界限可以帮助个人抵制参与“996”等过度工作文化的压力。这可能涉及协商工作时间、确定任务的优先顺序以及留出休息和个人兴趣的时间。

3.**社区建设**：创建或加入具有共同价值观的社区可以提供支持并鼓励抵消内卷化压力的做法。这些社区可以提供情感支持，分享平衡生活和工作的资源，并倡导工作场所和社会的系统性变革。

4.**替代教育和职业道路**：探索和追求符合个人兴趣和价值观的替代教育和职业道路，而不是仅仅关注传统的声望选择。这可能涉及职业培训、创业或新兴行业的职业，这些行业可能会提供更充实、更平衡的生活方式。

5.**倡导和对话**：与家人、同龄人和雇主就内卷压力和工作与生活平衡的重要性进行对话。倡导还可以扩展到支持促进教育改革、劳工权利和社会福利改善的政策和实践。

6.**个人福祉**：通过正念、锻炼和爱好等实践优先考虑个人福祉可以帮助个人管理压力并增强抵抗社会压力的能力。投资于个人成长和心理健康也可以提供做出偏离社会期望的选择的力量。

7.**财务规划和简单**：采用强调简单和谨慎消费的生活方式可以减少为了物质财富或地位象征而过度赚钱的压力。财务规划和储蓄策略还可以帮助个人实现稳定并减少对住房和退休的焦虑。

虽然个人行动本身可能不足以推翻内卷的系统性问题和囚徒困境中蕴含的社会压力，但集体努力和个人行为和态度的转变可以促进社会的逐步变革。随着越来越多的人质疑和挑战现状，有可能创造一个更加平衡、竞争更少的社会。

 Solving the problem of involution and the continuous prisoner’s dilemma in Chinese society from a personal perspective is challenging, given that these issues are deeply rooted in societal structures and cultural norms. However, individuals can take steps to navigate these pressures and potentially influence broader change over time. Here are several strategies that individuals might consider:

1.**Mindset Shift**: Cultivate a personal understanding that success and happiness can be defined in multiple ways, not just through academic achievement, career advancement, or material possessions. Embracing diverse definitions of success can help reduce the pressure to conform to societal expectations and enable individuals to pursue more fulfilling paths.

2.**Setting Boundaries**: Learning to set healthy boundaries around work and personal life can help individuals resist the pressure to engage in overwork cultures like “996.” This might involve negotiating work hours, prioritizing tasks, and making time for rest and personal interests.

3.**Community Building**: Creating or joining communities with shared values can provide support and encourage practices that counteract involutionary pressures. These communities can offer emotional support, share resources for balancing life and work, and advocate for systemic changes within workplaces and society.

4.**Alternative Education and Career Paths**: Exploring and pursuing alternative education and career paths that are aligned with personal interests and values, rather than solely focusing on traditionally prestigious options. This can involve vocational training, entrepreneurship, or careers in emerging industries that may offer more fulfilling and balanced lifestyles.

5.**Advocacy and Dialogue**: Engaging in dialogue with family, peers, and employers about the pressures of involution and the importance of work-life balance. Advocacy can also extend to supporting policies and practices that promote educational reform, labor rights, and social welfare improvements.

6.**Personal Well-being**: Prioritizing personal well-being through practices like mindfulness, exercise, and hobbies can help individuals manage stress and build resilience against societal pressures. Investing in personal growth and mental health can also provide the strength to make choices that diverge from societal expectations.

7.**Financial Planning and Simplicity**: Adopting a lifestyle that emphasizes simplicity and mindful consumption can reduce the pressure to earn excessively for the sake of material possessions or status symbols. Financial planning and saving strategies can also help individuals achieve stability and reduce anxiety about housing and retirement.

While individual actions alone may not be enough to overturn the systemic issues of involution and the societal pressures embedded in the prisoner’s dilemma, collective efforts and shifts in personal behaviors and attitudes can contribute to gradual societal change. As more people question and challenge the status quo, there is potential for creating a more balanced and less competitive society.
